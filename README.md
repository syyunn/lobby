# lobby
Generalize the goal of lobby research and current interested methodologies for those goals.

## Goals

As legislation continues to take shape, a wide range of sectors will continue flooding Congress with their lobbyists, trying to make sure that their particular concerns are fully addressed. These visualizations can help to better understand 
  1) who these interests are, 
  2) what they care about,
  3) and how intensely they are likely to lobby to get what they want.
